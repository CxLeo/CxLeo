# Hi there, I'm Leo ðŸ‘‹

A passionate web developer with one year of experience building full-stack web applications. I love turning ideas into interactive and user-friendly websites and applications. I started web development with a curiosity for coding, and it quickly turned into a full-blown passion of debugging.

### I like to work with
- Next.js, Redux, Tailwind, Framer-motion, Storybook, Express, Prisma

### I don't like to work with
- rude colleagues

## ðŸŒ± Currently Exploring
I'm currently diving deeper into **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **OpenAI API**. Iâ€™m excited about how these technologies can be integrated into web development to create smarter, more interactive applications.

Feel free to check out my projects and reach out if you want to collaborate or just talk tech!
